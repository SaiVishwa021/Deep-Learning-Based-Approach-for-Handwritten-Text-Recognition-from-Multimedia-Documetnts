## Beam Search Algorithm

## Beam Search Algorithm

The Beam Search Algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes within a limited set. It is particularly useful in sequence decoding problems, such as handwriting recognition or machine translation, where the goal is to find the most likely sequence of words or characters from a model's predictions.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the initial node (e.g., the beginning of the sequence) and initialize a beam width (k), which represents the number of top sequences to keep at each step.

2. **Expansion**:
   - At each step, expand all possible sequences from the current top sequences. Each possible next token or character is added to each of the current sequences to form new sequences.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Score the newly formed sequences based on their probability. This is usually done by the model's output probabilities.

4. **Selection**:
   - Select the top k sequences based on their scores and discard the rest. These top sequences are then used for the next step of expansion.

5. **Termination**:
   - Repeat the expansion, scoring, and selection steps until the end of the sequence is reached or a predefined stopping criterion is met.

### Visualization

Here's a visual representation of the Beam Search Algorithm:

In the diagram:
- The blue nodes represent the initial sequences.
- The nodes expand to new sequences based on the possible next tokens.
- The top paths are selected based on their scores (beam width).

### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of sequences explored compared to exhaustive search methods, making it feasible for long sequences.
- **Flexibility**: The beam width can be adjusted to balance between computational complexity and accuracy.

### Disadvantages

- **Beam Width Limitation**: A smaller beam width might miss the optimal sequence, while a larger width increases computation.
- **Greedy Approach**: Beam Search is heuristic and might not always find the optimal solution.
