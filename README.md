## Beam Search Algorithm

The Beam Search Algorithm is used to enhance the text decoding process by exploring multiple possible sequences. This technique helps in finding the most probable text sequence from the predicted outputs of the deep learning model. It maintains a fixed number of top sequences (beams) and iteratively expands them to improve the recognition accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model consists of handwritten text samples from various multimedia documents.
